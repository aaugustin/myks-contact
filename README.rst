Setup
=====

myks-contact is a pluggable Django application. It is tested with Django â‰¥ 1.8.

1.  Download and install the package from PyPI::

        $ pip install myks-contact

2.  Add ``contact`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

        INSTALLED_APPS += ['contact']

    This allows Django to discover the built-in templates and translations.

3. Define the list of recipients in the ``CONTACT_EMAILS`` setting::

        CONTACT_EMAILS = ['you@example.com']

4.  Add the application to your URLconf with the ``contact`` application
    namespace::

        urlpatterns += [
            url(r'^contact/', include('contact.urls', namespace='contact', app_name='contact')),
        ]

To use the built-in templates, your project's ``base.html`` template must
provide three blocks: ``title``, ``extrahead`` and ``content``, as shown in
this `example`_, and you must be using the staticfiles contrib app.

If these conditions are inconvenient, you can override the
``contact/form.html`` and ``contact/thanks.html`` templates.
